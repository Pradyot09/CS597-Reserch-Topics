## Abstract

Parallel K-Means: Clustering is one of the most popular methods for data analysis, which is prevalent in many disciplines such as image segmentation, bioinformatics, pattern recognition and statistics etc. The most popular and simplest clustering algorithm is K-means because of its easy implementation, simplicity, efficiency and empirical success. However, the real-world applications produce huge volumes of data, thus, how to efficiently handle of these data in an important mining task has been a challenging and significant issue. In addition, MPI (Message Passing Interface) as a programming model of message passing presents high performances, scalability and portability. Motivated by this, a parallel K-means clustering algorithm with MPI, called MKmeans, is proposed in this paper. The algorithm enables applying the clustering algorithm effectively in the parallel environment. Experimental study demonstrates that MKmeans is relatively stable and portable, and it performs with low overhead of time on large volumes of data sets. 


External Sorting: Sorting is one of the most common things we do in programming. We are given a bunch of numbers and we want to arrange them according to some rule. Let’s say we want to arrange them in ascending order. To sort these numbers, people tend to use a sorting algorithm that takes place entirely within the memory of a computer. The memory we are talking about is the RAM. Here, we take all the numbers and store them in the memory so that we can sort them. This is possible only when the amount of data is small enough to be stored in the memory. What if we have a hundred trillion numbers to be sorted? It’s too big to be stored in the computer’s memory.
